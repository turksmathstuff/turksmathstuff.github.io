## Notes 02
The Chain Rule is pretty much the last differentiation rule (you've still got techniques to learn, but those will just use the rules you've already learned).  Practice problems with using the chain rule on functions, with tables, with graphs.

## Notes 07
Print all three! These notes are about related rates.  We cover all the classics: falling ladders, cones, etc.  Additionally the [mastermathmentor.com notes (16)](https://mastermathmentor.com/calc/ABcalc.ashx) are really good and there are a lot of old FRQs that have great problems.  The ones we do: 1970AB4, 1972AB5, 1976AB4, 1977AB6, 1982 AB4, 1984 AB5, 1985 AB5, 1987 AB5, 1988 BC3, 1990 AB4, 1991 AB6, 1994 AB5, 1995 AB5.  Notes 07a is the problems, which you have to be in my class to see, but are freely available on the internet, as well, if you google around.  Notes 07b is space for doing the FRQs.  Also...the shadow problem!  Make sure you know and understand that problem!

## Notes 26
Integration by Parts (IBP); when dv = dx; repeated IBP; the table method (rapid repeated IBP); IBP that loops. [Here](http://youtu.be/sUKi-B9Slu0), [here](http://youtu.be/JIaupndIq8c), and [here](http://youtu.be/ywHDuhgf4hQ) are three videos of examples of pretty much each type.  For some reason the second video is the most popular...also, the integral of secant cubed is about as hard as an "easy" integral gets and it uses integration by parts.
