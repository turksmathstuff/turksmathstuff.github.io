I believe that if you have a plan for how to study, you can be very well prepared for the AP Calculus AB and BC exams and get a 5, which should be your ultimate goal.

# The Plan (Calc AB)
My class follows the assignments in the table below.  (I've just kind of estimated due dates because I'm doing this generically for any year, but they always start in mid-February and go until right around the Friday before AP exams start.)

# Target your review.
* [The Big Review Video Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1omZqpB0UkSJY1r4lPvEtojAa5NahVoW3ZxN0uLviKww/edit) The doc has links to specific topics covered in the course.  Find what you're bad at and get good!
* [A Focused Review of Limits](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j-khBU3NqaMR4wDaDsxGt7P2ILr2hMqC/view?usp=sharing)  In AP Calculus, limits don't need to trip you up.  Check this one out to review what you need to know.
* [Turning Riemann Sums to Definite Integrals](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cR3aQF9wpDUTzi1DwP8vAl_rjV_dLXMj/view?usp=sharing)  This is a fairly common multiple choice-type question, so learn not to be afraid of it.
* [Using dy for Integrals.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1haBgEwcW2T1t2iy5iyb4RNy3ypBMz-fB/view?usp=sharing)  This never seems to be anyone's favorite way to integrate, but you can definitely master it.
* [Calc AB Algebra before Integrating](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fmYVdovLNi5ogk_v0j6VYdu7UOKITdlf/view?usp=share_link)  You might need to complete the square, you might need to do long division.
* [Calc AB All Types of Integrals You Might Encounter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1szgoCbuXIDW3RrAg2qIybHxQzjc-YgQH/view?usp=sharing)  Why not just go through examples of everything you could face?

# Do a whole lot of practice problems!
* [Multiple Choice Review for AB & BC](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fRILjg4iWcqsDFQMhkVlMpCxUZX4bzw-?usp=sharing)  This is a series of problem sets with questions similar to what you'll see on the AP exam.  [There's a playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6iwkLfBjZixe5jzHd1gOW6e1vDO4hmDA) of the solution videos, too.  The playlist has a bunch of series, polar, parametric, and vector problems.
* [MasterMathMentor.com Demystifying Calc AB](https://mastermathmentor.com/calc/abmcexamprep.ashx)  A great collection of multiple choice problems that are sorted by topic.  Do them all!
* [MasterMathMentor.com Demystifying Calc BC](https://mastermathmentor.com/calc/bcmcexamprep.ashx)  Same as above, but targeted at BC topics.  Do them all!
