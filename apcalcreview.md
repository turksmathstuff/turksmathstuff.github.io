I believe that if you have a plan for how to study, you can be very well prepared for the AP Calculus AB and BC exams and get a 5, which should be your ultimate goal.

# The Plan (Calc AB)
My class follows the assignments in the table below.  (I've just kind of estimated due dates because I'm doing this generically for any year, but they always start in mid-February and go until right around the Friday before AP exams start.)  There are a lot of assignments and it is a lot of work, but it's worth it when most of the students get a 5 on the exam.

# What about Calc BC?
If you're in Calc BC, do everything for AB and then expand below for the list of additional assignments.

Doing all of this is probably too much.  If I had to choose anything to skip, it would be the non-multiple choice problems, the ones labled just Demyst BC.  If you're working hard at the FRQs you'll get more than enough of that type of problem.
  
# What are these assignments?
### The DemystMC Problems
These all  come from MasterMathMentor.com.  
* [Demystifying Calc AB](https://mastermathmentor.com/calc/abmcexamprep.ashx)  A great collection of multiple choice problems that are sorted by topic.  They're split up in the assignments above.
* [Demystifying Calc BC](https://mastermathmentor.com/calc/bcmcexamprep.ashx)  Same as above, but targeted at BC topics.

### Preparing Tests
Students in my classes purchase review books every year and we work through them.  There are two that I highly recommend, but they have a minimum order of 10 books so you'll need a teacher to organize it.  The first book is from [Venture Publishing](https://www.vent-pub.com/pab100/).  I've only ever used the AB book but it's outstanding.  The other book that I use with my students taking the BC exam is from [D&S Marketing](https://www.dsmarketing.com/).  I've only ever used the BC book from here, but again, it's outstanding.  The books from both companies contain 6 practice exams.

### AP MC
These are the real deal tests from previous years.  You can find the following officially released to the public exams: [1988](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/calculcus-free-exam-1988.pdf), [1998](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/calculcus-free-exam-1998.pdf), and [2012](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap-calculus-ab-practice-exam-2012.pdf?course=ap-calculus-ab).  There's a pdf of exams from: 1969, 1973, 1985, 1988, 1993, 1997, and 1998.  At some point you could buy the exams from 2003 and 2008 in paper format.  From 2013-2016 you used to be able to get them on the AP Audit site in pdf form if you were an audit approved teacher.  2017-2019 are pre-loaded into AP Classroom so teachers can assign them.  I do not distribute any copies of these exams, so don't ask me!

### If you can't get the books or the official AP practice tests
You can substitute basically any practice exams with the ones that I've listed.  For example, here's a link to [Amazon's results](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=ap+calculus+ab) for AP Calculus.  Personally I'd buy (or look for versions of) Barron's and Princeton Review.

# Free Response Questions
I believe that review time in class is best spent working through past Free Response questions.  You should do as many of them as possible.  If time is short, don't bother going back past 2016.  If you have the time, I'd go all the way back to 2006.  They move it from time to time, but [here's the College Board's archive of the problems strecthing back to 1998.](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-calculus-ab/exam/past-exam-questions)  Also, the previous year's questions can probably be found [here.](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-calculus-ab/exam)  If they're not at the links, you can find them by directly googling the year.

I have made video solutions to most of these FRQs.  I highly recommend you check them out.  Here's a [playlist.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA83584C88AB6F0AE)  Here's a [sorted spreadsheet of them.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dzyu3Q-3d4CZLV7lqQJzP7Cxq2UsiFJLu2K_4XPfMpM/edit#gid=1)

# Target your review.
The Demystifying AP Calculus stuff is sorted by topics, which is great.  You have to know the name of the thing you're not good at so you can find more problems and resources to practice and improve.  Here are (most?) of the things that I've made for AP review.
* [The Big Review Video Document.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1omZqpB0UkSJY1r4lPvEtojAa5NahVoW3ZxN0uLviKww/edit) The doc has links to specific topics covered in the course.  Find what you're bad at and get good!
* [A Focused Review of Limits.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j-khBU3NqaMR4wDaDsxGt7P2ILr2hMqC/view?usp=sharing)  In AP Calculus, limits don't need to trip you up.  Check this one out to review what you need to know.
* [Turning Riemann Sums to Definite Integrals.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cR3aQF9wpDUTzi1DwP8vAl_rjV_dLXMj/view?usp=sharing)  This is a fairly common multiple choice-type question, so learn not to be afraid of it.
* [Using dy for Integrals.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1haBgEwcW2T1t2iy5iyb4RNy3ypBMz-fB/view?usp=sharing)  This never seems to be anyone's favorite way to integrate, but you can definitely master it.
* [Calc AB Algebra before Integrating.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fmYVdovLNi5ogk_v0j6VYdu7UOKITdlf/view?usp=share_link)  You might need to complete the square, you might need to do long division.
* [Calc AB All Types of Integrals You Might Encounter.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1szgoCbuXIDW3RrAg2qIybHxQzjc-YgQH/view?usp=sharing)  Why not just go through examples of everything you could face?
* [Multiple Choice Review for AB & BC](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fRILjg4iWcqsDFQMhkVlMpCxUZX4bzw-?usp=sharing)  This is a series of problem sets with questions similar to what you'll see on the AP exam.  [There's a playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6iwkLfBjZixe5jzHd1gOW6e1vDO4hmDA) of the solution videos, too.  The playlist has a bunch of series, polar, parametric, and vector problems.
