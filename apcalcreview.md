If you have a plan for how to study, you can be very well prepared for the AP Calculus AB and BC exams.

# Target your review.
* [The Big Review Video Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1omZqpB0UkSJY1r4lPvEtojAa5NahVoW3ZxN0uLviKww/edit) The doc has links to specific topics covered in the course.  Find what you're bad at and get good!
* [A Focused Review of Limits](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j-khBU3NqaMR4wDaDsxGt7P2ILr2hMqC/view?usp=sharing)  In AP Calculus, limits don't need to trip you up.  Check this one out to review what you need to know.
* [Turning Riemann Sums to Definite Integrals](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cR3aQF9wpDUTzi1DwP8vAl_rjV_dLXMj/view?usp=sharing)  This is a fairly common multiple choice-type question, so learn not to be afraid of it.
* [Using dy for Integrals.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1haBgEwcW2T1t2iy5iyb4RNy3ypBMz-fB/view?usp=sharing)  This never seems to be anyone's favorite way to integrate, but you can definitely master it.
* [Calc AB Algebra before Integrating](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fmYVdovLNi5ogk_v0j6VYdu7UOKITdlf/view?usp=share_link)  You might need to complete the square, you might need to do long division.
* [Calc AB All Types of Integrals You Might Encounter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1szgoCbuXIDW3RrAg2qIybHxQzjc-YgQH/view?usp=sharing)  Why not just go through examples of everything you could face?

# Do a whole lot of practice problems!
* [Multiple Choice Review for AB & BC](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fRILjg4iWcqsDFQMhkVlMpCxUZX4bzw-?usp=sharing)  This is a series of problem sets with questions similar to what you'll see on the AP exam.  [There's a playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6iwkLfBjZixe5jzHd1gOW6e1vDO4hmDA) of the solution videos, too.  The playlist has a bunch of series, polar, parametric, and vector problems.
* [MasterMathMentor.com Demystifying Calc AB](https://mastermathmentor.com/calc/abmcexamprep.ashx)  A great collection of multiple choice problems that are sorted by topic.  Do them all!
* [MasterMathMentor.com Demystifying Calc BC](https://mastermathmentor.com/calc/bcmcexamprep.ashx)  Same as above, but targeted at BC topics.  Do them all!
