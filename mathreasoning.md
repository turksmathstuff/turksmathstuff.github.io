# Math Reasoning Notes and Videos
Math Reasoning was a pretty amazing course that I taugth for a couple of years.  It was meant to bridge the gap between Algebra 1 from middle school and Honors Algebra II in high school, where the expectation and rigor are far greater.  There's a tacit assumption that students working on these notes have taken Algebra 1 but that they weren't amazing at it.  **This page is a work in progress.**  (But the links to the notes and playlists work!)

## Notes 01
The distributive property applied to polynomials.  (You've got to move beyond FOIL if you're going to excel!)  Also, how to use your TI-Nspire CXII CAS to expand products.

## Notes 02
Factoring, the opposite of distributing!  Looking for the GCF.  Factoring with a leading coefficient of 1 by educated guessing and pattern recognition.  Factoring with prime leading coefficient using educated guessing and pattern recognition.  Factoring with composite leading coefficient, educated guessing and pattern recognition.  Basically a st of 277 factoring problems.

## Notes 03
How comfortable you are with fractions will go a long way to determining how well you do in Algebra II and beyond.  In these notes we simplify fractions; add & subtract fractions; multiply & divide fractions.

## Notes 04
More techniques of factoring!  Using the _ac_-method.  If a quadratic factors you can basically always use the _ac_-method, so if the pattern recognition hasn't been working great for you, this is the one to focus on!  Also, factoring a sum and difference of cubes using formulas.

## Notes 05
Solving some simple equations.  Solving systems of linear equations using calculators, subsitution, elimination (linear combinations), and symmetry.  Using your calculator to solve a system of equations.  Solving a system of three equations in three unknowns.  Introducing the idea of a matrix to solve a system of equations.
