# Math Reasoning Notes and Videos
Math Reasoning was a pretty amazing course that I taugth for a couple of years.  It was meant to bridge the gap between Algebra 1 from middle school and Honors Algebra II in high school, where the expectation and rigor are far greater.  There's a tacit assumption that students working on these notes have taken Algebra 1 but that they weren't amazing at it.

## Notes 01
The distributive property applied to polynomials.  (You've got to move beyond FOIL if you're going to excel!)  Also, how to use your TI-Nspire CXII CAS to expand products.

## Notes 02
Factoring, the opposite of distributing!  Looking for the GCF.  Factoring with a leading coefficient of 1 by educated guessing and pattern recognition.  Factoring with prime leading coefficient using educated guessing and pattern recognition.  Factoring with composite leading coefficient, educated guessing and pattern recognition.  Basically a st of 277 factoring problems.
