# Gemini Overview

Talk to it like a normal person who’s just really good at tons of things.

- At the bottom of each response you’ll see: **Redo**, **Share & Export**, **Copy**, **More**  
  - **Share & Export** can go straight to Google Docs or Gmail drafts.  
  - **Copy** is what I use the most by far.

### 3) Have It Build a Webpage for Your Lesson

Ask for a single-file, modern page with HTML/CSS/JS/MathJax and built-in practice.

> **💬 Prompt**

 ```text
 I have to teach about asymptotes of rational functions tomorrow and I'd like to have a detailed,
modern looking webpage to use that will generate questions for my students to answer.
the questions should give a rational function (in factored form) and ask for asymptotes
(vertical, horizontal, and slant), removable discontinuities, and zeros.
Please use html5, javascript, css, mathjax, and any other tools you think will give the best result.
I'd like it all in one single file.
 ```
