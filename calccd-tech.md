* [Direction cosines](https://www.geogebra.org/classic/yb4hdmjk)  A sketch that shows a vector and then triangles to represent the planes in which to look for the angles alpha, beta, and gamma.  Turn on/off the polygons and the angles.
* [Direction cosines again](https://www.geogebra.org/classic/m743gwd4)  An interesting sketch where you can see the cones determined by the angles alpha, beta, and gamma and their intersection.
