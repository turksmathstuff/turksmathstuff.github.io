## Calc D Notes 1

* [Direction cosines](https://www.geogebra.org/classic/yb4hdmjk)  A sketch that shows a vector and then triangles to represent the planes in which to look for the angles alpha, beta, and gamma.  Turn on/off the polygons and the angles.
* [Direction cosines again](https://www.geogebra.org/classic/m743gwd4)  An interesting sketch where you can see the cones determined by the angles alpha, beta, and gamma and their intersection.

## Calc D Notes 5

* [Directional Derivative, Gradient, and Steepest Ascent/Descent.](https://www.geogebra.org/classic/jgFYzVkC)  This sketch has three panels: one that shows the xy-plane and has a point, a unit vector, and the gradient; one that shows a graph of the value of the directional derivative as a function of the angle between the gradient and the unit vector; and one that shows the surface with the tangent line to the surface, the gradient, and the unit vector.
